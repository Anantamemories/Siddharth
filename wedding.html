        cultures, ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes. Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of
        marriage vows by a couple, presentation of a gift (offering, rings, symbolic item, flowers, money, dress), and a public
        proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant.</p>
