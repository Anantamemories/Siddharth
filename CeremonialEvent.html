        <p class="text-center m-3"  style="color: #FFFFFF ;">Indian Weddings are filled to the brim with vibrant, cultural events lasting over the course of a few days. The Haldi,
        Mehndi, and Sangeet all play a very important role in the celebration of the union of two people. The culmination of all
        these events, however, is the wedding day which in and of itself consists of significant moments of religion and culture
        that pull together to create a beautiful celebration of marriage and Indian culture. It is important to have a set
        wedding timeline so that all of these major events can all run smoothly and according to how you want your wedding to
        be. Below is an example Indian Wedding Timeline which allows for the key moments of the day while incorporating the time
        needed to capture all your beautiful memories.</p>

                    <p class="mt-5">Before the couple are married, they go through the Haldi ceremony, which is where their families gather to spread oil,
                    water, and turmeric over the couple. The mixture goes everywhere, over their skin and clothes, and is believed to bless
                    the couple. It also has the double effect of moisturizing their skin before the wedding later that day.</p>

                    <p class="mt-5">Only the women in the families attend the Mehendi, which is probably the most recognised Indian wedding tradition. It is
                    where the bride has her hands and feet adorned with intricate henna designs, which signify the bond between her and her
                    future husband. Once the ceremony is finished and the parents give the bride away, they do not eat again before the
                    wedding to remain pure.</p>

                    <p class="mt-5">This party can be a stand-alone event, or be connected with the Mehendi ceremony. The Sangeet is a celebration where
                    both families get together to sing and dance. This can be restricted to just the women, or open for all to enjoy.</p>
